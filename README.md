# Decision-Tree
# Decision Tree Information Gain Analysis

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to calculate the information gain for each feature in a dataset using a Decision Tree classifier. The project includes code to visualize the information gain for each feature, helping identify the most significant feature based on information gain.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is stored in a CSV file named `hw6.data.csv`. It is assumed that the last column in the dataset represents the labels, and all other columns represent the features.

## Files
- `main.py`: The main Python script that performs the information gain analysis and visualizes the results.
- `images/`: Directory to store the generated plot images.
- `hw6.data.csv`: The dataset file.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib



##  Usage
Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/decision-tree-info-gain.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd decision-tree-info-gain

Ensure the dataset file hw6.data.csv is present in the project directory.

Run the main script:

python tree.py

This will perform the information gain analysis and generate a plot of the information gain for each feature, saved in the images directory.

Visualization

The script generates a bar plot showing the information gain for each feature. The plot is saved as information_gain.png in the images directory.
